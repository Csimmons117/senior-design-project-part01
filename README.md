# CSUN CIT 480 Senior Project — Gym App Revamp (Web Version)

## Overview
This project is our **senior design capstone** for CIT 480 at CSUN.  
We are redesigning our school’s gym system as a **web application** that integrates campus identity services, secure check-ins, and guided coaching.

## System Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
We are following the SDLC as aligned with **CIT 480 course topics**:
1. **Requirements Gathering** → Stakeholder interviews, use cases, DFDs/BPMN  
2. **System & Data Modeling** → ERD, DB schema, process models  
3. **Design** → Architecture diagrams, UI prototypes, ADRs  
4. **Implementation (Phase I)** → Vertical slice (login, check-in, GPT coaching, admin basics)  
5. **Transition & Acceptance** → Deployment runbook, acceptance tests
